python HOW TO LOCK WORD DOC SECTION:

https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/lock-the-2nd-page-in-word-while-making-chages-in/50f5f214-3e7f-4f6f-b6e3-76696f5742a4

This is possible, though as Paul mentions, not foolproof:

    In Word, select the content on Page 1 that you want to be editable.
    Click on the Review tab, then select Restrict Editing.
    Under Editing Restrictions, check Allow only this type of editing in the document. Leave the dropdown below set to the default No changes (read only).
    Under Exceptions, check Everyone.
    Click on Yes, Start Enforcing Protection. Save the file.
    Test whether the document operates the way you want. You should be able to edit in the areas you had selected and nowhere else.

cx_Freeze
cx_Freeze is a set of scripts and modules for freezing Python scripts into executables, in much the same way that py2exe and py2app do. Unlike these two tools, cx_Freeze is cross platform and should work on any platform that Python itself works on. It supports Python 3.5 or higher (for Python 2.7 use cx_Freeze version 5). 
https://pythonprogramming.net/converting-python-scripts-exe-executables/

python -m pip install cx_Freeze --upgrade

Make a setup.py script then run 
python setup.py build

sample setup.py build
from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable
myfullpath = "C:\\Users\\gdangca\\OneDrive - Infor\\Projects\\Project - Python\\HR DocSign\\Signature Applet.py"
executables = [Executable(myfullpath, base='Win32GUI',
                        shortcutName=appname)]

setup(
      name=appname,
      executables=executables
)
